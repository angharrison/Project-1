Description: Project 1 is Tower of Hanoi, a mathmatical puzzle consisting of a number of disks of different sizes, which can slide onto any tower. The objective is to move the entire tower to another rod obeying the game rules:

  1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
  2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.
  3. No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

  They can move each disk at one time, not playing a disk onto a smaller disk. They can reset the game using the button.
  Bronze: HTML page with disks and towers structure
  Silver: Css to add game features, "reset, instructions, game winner"
  Gold: disk movements, game over, time based scoring, track scores across games

  This project was designed using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
  I had a few problems with my project. Some like the game over, game rules button, and winner alert left unresolved.

  While working on the active section establishing a click, my disks kept disappearing. Initially I had a problem keeping my towers stationary.
